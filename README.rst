This folder contains jupyter notebooks demonstrating different ways to
implement pyjanitor in your workflow.

Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~

When contributing example notebooks please include a short explanation of
where the data came from and what it contains. Then go through your
demonstration of data cleaning with pyjanitor in a step by step manner with
clear documentation of what is being done. Please try to elaborate on what the
benefits of pyjanitor are and why it should be implemented in your use-case.
Optionally, feel free to add examples of analysis for the cleaned data.
